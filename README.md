### What is allegro.ts?

_allegro.ts_ is a project which attempts to map the entire allegro 4 api to javascript in as close of a manner as possible.

This is based on [allegro.js](https://github.com/TheSos/allegrojs) an earlier project to bring the allegro 4 library to the browser. This differs by attempting to make a 1 to 1 mapping from allegro 4 to the browser which allows for the use as an emscripten library.
